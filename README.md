# Recent AI-Related Work by Benjamin Bertram

 ([Comfy.ui Kurs » AI Workflows erstellen](https://tomorrowacademy.org/seminare/comfy-ui)) *Benjamin Bertram (Illustrator & Creative Technologist)*  
Bertram’s fascination with technology led him to explore AI-assisted design as early as 2018 ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=Interesting%20patterns%2C%20shapes%2C%20objects%20and,assisted%20design%20since%202018)). Based in Hamburg, Germany, he works on visual design projects for clients across business, culture, education, and research ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=As%20an%20illustrator%20and%20designer,business%2C%20culture%2C%20education%20and%20research)). Below is an overview of his recent AI-focused projects and roles in media, academia, art, and technology.

## ARD Documentary: *Der Autokraten-Code* (2024)

 ([Der Autokraten-Code – fernsehserien.de](https://www.fernsehserien.de/filme/der-autokraten-code)) *Scene from ARD’s AI-themed documentary “Der Autokraten-Code” (2024), where six experts – including Benjamin Bertram (left) – build a virtual political figure using AI* ([Der Autokraten-Code – fernsehserien.de](https://www.fernsehserien.de/filme/der-autokraten-code#:~:text=Hacker%20Marco%20di%20Filipo%20%28r,einen%20virtuellen%20Politiker%20zu%20erschaffen)). In late 2024, Bertram appeared as the AI imagery expert in the ARD documentary **“Der Autokraten-Code”** ([Der Autokraten-Code – fernsehserien.de](https://www.fernsehserien.de/filme/der-autokraten-code#:~:text=Hacker%20Marco%20di%20Filipo%20%28r,einen%20virtuellen%20Politiker%20zu%20erschaffen)). This film follows an unprecedented experiment in which six experts use various AI systems over six weeks to create a virtual autocratic politician, exploring how AI could be leveraged to influence democratic societies ([Der Autokraten-Code – fernsehserien.de](https://www.fernsehserien.de/filme/der-autokraten-code#:~:text=Hacker%20Marco%20di%20Filipo%20%28r,einen%20virtuellen%20Politiker%20zu%20erschaffen)). Bertram’s role in the project highlighted his expertise in generative AI and deepfakes, contributing to discussions on the potential misuse of AI in politics ([Wird KI zum Werkzeug der MACHT? - 22 Nov 2024 - HÖRZU - Readly](https://de.readly.com/magazines/horzu/2024-11-22/673e98656c1798eaf2554f48?srsltid=AfmBOooiqFFOZrempbgPHT3swESPE3trL75aegrCEGFMePYPMgYr3Lv9#:~:text=Wird%20KI%20zum%20Werkzeug%20der,dass%20an%20der%20Echtheit)) ([Der Autokraten-Code – fernsehserien.de](https://www.fernsehserien.de/filme/der-autokraten-code#:~:text=Image%3A%20Hacker%20Marco%20di%20Filipo,Goldenstedt)). The documentary aired on German public television (ARD) in December 2024, drawing national attention to these AI-driven scenarios.

## Teaching AI at Bezalel Academy (Jerusalem, 2023)

In early 2023, Bertram served as a research assistant and instructor at the **Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design** in Jerusalem, within the Department of Architecture ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=Since%202023%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Founding%20partner%C2%A0and%20creative,ai)). In this academic role he introduced architecture students to creative applications of AI, blending design with computational techniques. His tenure at Bezalel coincided with his graduate studies there (2022–2023) and involved guiding projects that integrated generative AI into architectural design processes ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=Spring%202023%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Research%20assistant%20and,of%20Arts%20Jerusalem%2C%20Department%20Architecture)).

## AI-Related Art and Design Exhibitions (2023)

Bertram’s creative work has been showcased in exhibitions both in Germany and internationally. In 2023 he contributed to a group art exhibition titled *“Offen, vielfältig, multikulturell”* (“Open, Diverse, Multicultural”) at the Town Hall in Sondershausen, Germany ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=2023%20%E2%80%93%20Talk%20at%20the%C2%A0Rhein,of%20Applied%20Sciences)). Around the same time, he exhibited design research at the *International Conference on Urbanism and Urbanization* in Jerusalem (hosted by Bezalel Academy), demonstrating how AI tools can intersect with urban and architectural design ([Benjamin Bertram - Illustrator and Creative Technologist - About](https://benjaminbertram.com/about#:~:text=2023%20%E2%80%93%20Exhibition%20at%20the,on%20Urbanism%20and%20Urbanization%2C%20Jerusalem)). These exhibitions reflect Bertram’s engagement with socio-cultural themes and emerging technologies in art, positioning his work at the intersection of creativity and innovation.

## AI Workshops with Tomorrow Academy (2023–2025)

Bertram is actively involved in industry workshops that teach practical uses of AI in design. He has been a guest instructor with the **Tomorrow Academy**, co-leading interactive online workshops on generative AI workflows for marketing and creative professionals ([Workshop: KI in Marketing & Produktentwicklung](https://tomorrowacademy.org/ai-act-compliance#:~:text=Peter%20wird%20im%20Workshop%20unterst%C3%BCtzt,Illustrator%20und%20Creative%20Technologist)). For example, he supports a seminar on *“KI in Marketing & Produktentwicklung”* (AI in Marketing & Product Development) alongside Prof. Peter Kabel, where participants learn to use tools like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion in real-world projects ([Workshop: KI in Marketing & Produktentwicklung](https://tomorrowacademy.org/ai-act-compliance#:~:text=Peter%20wird%20im%20Workshop%20unterst%C3%BCtzt,Illustrator%20und%20Creative%20Technologist)) ([Workshop: KI in Marketing & Produktentwicklung](https://tomorrowacademy.org/ai-act-compliance#:~:text=Wir%20arbeiten%20im%20Workshop%20mit,alle%20TeilnehmerInnen%2C%20sich%20daf%C3%BCr%20anzumelden)). He also leads a course on building AI image-generation workflows with ComfyUI, sharing his expertise as an illustrator and *Creative Technologist* to help others integrate AI into their creative process ([Comfy.ui Kurs » AI Workflows erstellen](https://tomorrowacademy.org/seminare/comfy-ui#:~:text=Benjamins%20Wurzeln%20liegen%20in%20der,unterschiedlichster%20generativer%20AIs%20miteinander%20vernetzt)). These workshops, conducted in 2023–2024 (with new sessions scheduled for 2025), underscore Bertram’s role in educating peers about cutting-edge AI tools and techniques.

## Founding of CogniWerk.ai (2023–Present)

In 2023, Benjamin Bertram co-founded **CogniWerk.ai**, a startup platform designed to make generative AI more accessible to artists and designers ([Comfy.ui Kurs » AI Workflows erstellen](https://tomorrowacademy.org/seminare/comfy-ui#:~:text=Benjamins%20Wurzeln%20liegen%20in%20der,unterschiedlichster%20generativer%20AIs%20miteinander%20vernetzt)). CogniWerk provides a user-friendly, browser-based interface that connects various generative AI models and workflows, allowing creative professionals to leverage tools like text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, and ControlNet in one place ([Mr. Zitzlaff proudly presents … CogniWerk.ai | Martin Zitzlaff Photo Film Hamburg : Corporate - Medical - Portrait](https://zitzlaff.com/cogniwerk/#:~:text=professional%20creatives)). Branded as an “ultimate creative co-pilot,” the platform streamlines AI-driven image creation for specific use cases ([Mr. Zitzlaff proudly presents … CogniWerk.ai | Martin Zitzlaff Photo Film Hamburg : Corporate - Medical - Portrait](https://zitzlaff.com/cogniwerk/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Bertram%2C%20co,of%20just%20under%2025%20minutes)). Bertram serves as a creative technologist for CogniWerk, often demonstrating its capabilities through tutorials and talks – for instance, explaining how to generate new visuals from hand-drawn sketches using the platform’s suite of AI tools ([Mr. Zitzlaff proudly presents … CogniWerk.ai | Martin Zitzlaff Photo Film Hamburg : Corporate - Medical - Portrait](https://zitzlaff.com/cogniwerk/#:~:text=Benjamin%20Bertram%2C%20co,of%20just%20under%2025%20minutes)). CogniWerk.ai continues to evolve as an innovative resource, reflecting Bertram’s commitment to bridging creativity with advanced AI technology.
